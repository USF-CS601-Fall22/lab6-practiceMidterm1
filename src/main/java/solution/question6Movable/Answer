Assume that Movable is an interface, and that classes Alien and Vehicle implement Movable.

Specify which of the statements below are valid. For invalid statements, explain why they are invalid.

1. Movable m = new Movable();
2. Movable ma = new Alien();
3. Movable mv = new Vehicle();
4. Alien a = new Movable();
5. Object o = new Alien();
6. Vehicle v  = new Alien();
7. Vehicle v1 = (Vehicle)(new Alien());

Solution:
1. Invalid. Cannot instantiate an interface.
2. Valid
3. Valid
4. Invalid. Cannot instantiate an interface.
5. Valid. Upcasting.
6. Invalid. Alien and Vehicle are not in inheritance relationship. Cannot assign sibling references to each other.
7. Invalid. Alien and Vehicle are not in inheritance relationship. Cannot assign sibling references to each other, whether you cast or not.
